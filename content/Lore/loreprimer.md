In a distant corner of the universe, a mysterious event caused the worlds of magic and technology to collide, creating a new dimension where both coexisted. This dimension, known as "The Merge," became a haven for adventurers and outcasts from across the multiverse.

As one of the few beings capable of using both magic and technology, you have stumbled upon The Merge and have been drawn into its wild and dangerous landscape. You are not alone, however. Other dimension hoppers like yourself have also made their way to The Merge, each with their own unique abilities and expertise.

In the aftermath of the Great Collision, the inhabitants of The Merge are struggling to come to terms with their new reality. Some see the collision as an opportunity to forge a new path, combining magic and technology to achieve incredible feats. Others are more resistant to change and cling to the traditional ways of their respective worlds.

As a dimension hopper, you have the unique ability to use both magic and technology to your advantage.  The choice is yours, but be warned - The Merge is a dangerous place, and not everyone can be trusted. Other dimension hoppers, who may have their own agendas, could pose a threat to your safety and the balance of power in The Merge.
