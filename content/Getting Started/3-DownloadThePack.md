Due to rapid updates to the pack, the best way to install the pack is through the Prism Launcher!  Download the prism launcher from [their website](https://prismlauncher.org) for your platform, and then download the pack from our discord!

{{<hint type="important" title="Watch out!">}}
The modpack requires that the user download **specifically** Java 17!  No newer version of Java seems to work.  Luckily, you can keep your main version of Java separate from the copy of Java 17, and simply point the Prism launcher to a copy of Java 17 for Minecraft!  I recommend downloading Java 17 from oracle at [their website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).
{{</hint>}}

The latest version of the modpack should be available as a Prism launcher export in the #pack-download channel in The Merge discord.  If you do not have access to this discord, please let Nathan know and he can send you an invite!
