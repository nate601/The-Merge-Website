Welcome to The Merge, a dimension where magic and technology coexist in a fragile balance. You are a dimension hopper, one of the few beings capable of using both magic and technology, who has stumbled upon this strange and dangerous world.

In The Merge, you will encounter a variety of creatures, both friendly and hostile, as you explore the vast landscape. Remember, trust is a fragile thing in The Merge, and not everyone can be trusted. You must be careful to choose your allies wisely and be prepared for any eventuality.

We hope you enjoy your time in The Merge and make the most of your unique abilities as a dimension hopper. The fate of the dimension is in your hands. Good luck!

Hello and welcome to our brand new private modded Minecraft server!

I am excited to have you join us as we embark on this journey together. This server has been created specifically for our group of friends to play on, and we hope you have a great time.

On this server, we have a variety of mods installed to enhance gameplay and add new features to the game. Be sure to check out the list of mods on the server page to get an idea of what we have available.  The server is on the newest version of Minecraft (1.19), and has a bunch of features that I have yet to play with.  I am excited to build something interesting with you!
