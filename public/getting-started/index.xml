      <description>Welcome to The Merge, a dimension where magic and technology coexist in a fragile balance. You are a dimension hopper, one of the few beings capable of using both magic and technology, who has stumbled upon this strange and dangerous world.
In The Merge, you will encounter a variety of creatures, both friendly and hostile, as you explore the vast landscape. Remember, trust is a fragile thing in The Merge, and not everyone can be trusted.</description>

      <title>Download the Pack!</title>
      <link>http://merge.nate601.me/Getting-Started/3-DownloadThePack/</link>

      <description>Due to rapid updates to the pack, the best way to install the pack is through the Prism Launcher! Download the prism launcher from their website for your platform, and then download the pack from our discord!
The modpack requires that the user download specifically Java 17! No newer version of Java seems to work. Luckily, you can keep your main version of Java separate from the copy of Java 17, and simply point the Prism launcher to a copy of Java 17 for Minecraft!</description>
